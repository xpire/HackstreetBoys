Accenture Hackathon 2019 on Blockchain

Implemented a Blockchain written in Python with traffic simulation, to demonstrate product which combines Social Media with Blockchain to verify charity donations, and where blocks that have been verified on the chain are automatically posted onto user's Social Media pages. This provides visibility to the public blockchain, abstracting and filtering the useful information to be neatly presented.
